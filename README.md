Notes on Morvan's Git Tutorial

[Morvan's tutorial on Git](https://morvanzhou.github.io/tutorials/others/git/)
Meanwhile, this is the [Github tutorial](http://youngxhui.github.io/tags/GitHub/) on [Github for Windows](https://desktop.github.com/) that I found useful

Tips: both these two tutorials are in Chinese.

Thanks bro!!
